# 🏦 Virtual Bank Account System

## 📖 About
This is a console-based banking application developed as the first challenge for the **Oracle Next Education (ONE)** program. The goal was to create a functional user interface in the terminal to simulate basic banking operations, focusing on Java syntax and control flow logic.

## ⚙️ Features
* **Account Dashboard:** Displays customer name, account type, and initial balance.
* **Balance Check:** Users can verify their current funds instantly.
* **Deposits:** Allows users to input an amount to receive/deposit into the account.
* **Transfers:** Includes validation logic to prevent transfers if the balance is insufficient.
* **Interactive Menu:** A loop-based menu (`while`) that keeps the application running until the user chooses to exit.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
* **Language:** Java
* **Input Handling:** `Scanner` class for reading user data.
* **Control Flow:** `switch` case for menu selection and `if/else` for validation.
* **Loops:** `while` loop to maintain the application state.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Run the `BankSystem.java` file.
4. Interact with the menu via the console.
